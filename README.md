![Elgg 2.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elgg-2.3-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

## Features

 * Strips core CSS and rewrites everything from scratch using [Bulma.io](http://bulma.io)
 * Reimagines layouts, item views and navigation
 

## Notes

Note that this plugin/theme will likely have incompatibilities with other third party plugins.
The intention here is not to ensure broad compatibility, rather to demonstrate best practices for reducing boilerplate and implementing scalable/extendable themes.
